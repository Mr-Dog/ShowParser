# ShowParser
Looks through RSS feed and gets the first episode of the show. All others are disregarded.

Was created for use with private trackers that do not support sickrage and you do not want to download duplicates.

It checks your RSS feed for shows that you like and only downloads the very first episode that is uploaded.
At this point in time, there is no support for Quality but will add it over time.
The torrents are downloaded to a folder where you can set your Torrent Application to look for and consume.


Steps: 

1. Create Shows.txt file, where each line contains the name of the show you would like
2. Fill in all fields in script that have ****
3. Install FeedParser for python
4. Schedule the script to run :)
